# Synonyms Guesser

Given some synonyms to a word, can you guess the secret word? Try your luck!

The wrong guesses will go into the guess bucket and the guesses that are close to the secret word will turn a warm colour.

A new word will be available each day!

## Contributing

So you want to contribute? Yay! Great! Fun! I love seeing new PRs for Clueless Words. That being said, not every pull request will be merged. The general guidelines I'll follow are:

- Does it make developing Cluesless Words easier?
- Are you doing a PR into the development branch?
- Does it fix a bug?
- Does it break anything?
- Does it stick to the original goal of Clueless Words (a simple, daily word game)
- Does it reduce the build size?
- Is it necessary?

Regarding PRs in to development, please make all PR into the development branch as main is reserved for production. Further, in regards to the last point, I don't expect all pull requests to be absolutely necessary. New features are good, however, if the new features make the game unnecessarily complex in some way without bringing value to the users, it won't be merged.
